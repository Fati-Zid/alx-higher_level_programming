# Python - More Classes and Objects (0x08)

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring advanced concepts related to classes and objects in Python. It covers topics such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

## Topics Covered

1. **Inheritance:** Understanding and implementing inheritance in Python classes.
2. **Encapsulation:** Exploring encapsulation principles to control access to class attributes.
3. **Polymorphism:** Demonstrating polymorphic behavior with Python classes and methods.
4. **Special Methods:** Utilizing special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.) for customizing class behavior.

## Project Structure

- Each topic is likely to have its own Python file or folder.
- Clear organization and separation of concerns for each concept.
