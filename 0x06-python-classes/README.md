## Fati-Zid's Python Class Project - 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This repository contains solutions to the tasks for the "0x06. Python - Classes and Objects" project, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

### About OOP and Learning Objectives

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in programming, especially in Python. This project aims to provide a hands-on experience with OOP and covers key concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and more.

#### Resources

Before diving into the tasks, it is highly recommended to go through the provided learning resources to understand the fundamentals of OOP in Python.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of OOP. The tasks are designed to build a solid understanding of Python classes and objects.

- **Task 0: My first square**
  - Introduction to creating an empty class `Square`.

- **Task 1: Square with size**
  - Defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.

- **Task 2: Size validation**
  - Enhancing the `Square` class with size validation.

- **Task 3: Area of a square**
  - Adding a public instance method to calculate the area of a square.

- **Task 4: Access and update private attribute**
  - Implementing getter and setter methods for the private attribute `size`.

- **Task 5: Printing a square**
  - Adding a public instance method to print the square using the `#` character.

- **Task 6: Coordinates of a square**
  - Extending the `Square` class to include a position attribute and implementing printing based on position.

- **Task 7: Singly linked list**
  - Writing a class `Node` to define a node of a singly linked list, and a class `SinglyLinkedList` to define a singly linked list with a sorted insert method.

- **Task 8: Print Square instance**
  - Enhancing the `Square` class to print instances in a formatted way.

- **Task 9: Compare 2 squares**
  - Adding comparators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) to the `Square` class based on the square area.

- **Task 10: ByteCode -> Python #5**
  - Writing the Python class `MagicClass` to replicate a given Python bytecode.

### Requirements

- Code is written and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
- All modules, classes, and functions include documentation.

### How to Run

To test and run the code for each task, execute the corresponding main script (e.g., `0-main.py`, `1-main.py`, etc.) in the terminal.
