# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Author

## Background Context

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and practice of Test-driven development (TDD) in Python. The development process follows a set of guidelines to enhance code quality and robustness. Here are some important points to note:

### Intranet Checks for Python Projects

Starting from today, adhere to the following requirements for Python projects:

- Always write documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before actual coding.
- The intranet checks for Python projects wonâ€™t be released before their first deadline, allowing you to focus more on TDD and consider all possible cases.

### Collaboration on Test Cases

We strongly encourage collaboration on test cases. Working together ensures that all possible edge cases are considered, minimizing the risk of oversight. However, collaboration should be limited to test case development and not extend to the implementation.

### User Input and Edge Cases

Always adopt a cautious approach to user input and consider all possible edge cases. Do not trust the user implicitly; validate input thoroughly to ensure the robustness of your code.

## Important Notice

Prioritize TDD in your development process, think comprehensively about test cases, and collectively work on ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the codebase.

Happy coding!
